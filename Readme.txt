ONFLIX APPLICATION

This is a vanilla JavaScript-based movie information application using TMDB API version 3. 

This contains a slider for films that are currently playing, a search box for films and TV shows with complete pagination, and description pages for the most popular films and series. The Swiper library is used by the slider. 


I'm practicing this to get better at coding in JavaScript.
